This is my amazing paper, in which I will tell you all about the joys
of version control using \code{git}.

\section{The Wonders of Git} % Produces section heading.  Lower-level
                             % sections are begun with similar 
                             % \subsection and \subsubsection commands.

This paper is written using
\LaTeX,    % The \LaTeX command generates the LaTeX logo.
but that's not the point. The point is that all my
work is safe because I've used version control!

\section{Going Crazy}
Here we go. I'm going to try and import a file of code
into this document as a listing. What are the chances it
works? We'll see...
